**Hi üëã**

 My Journey into Pentesting

I'm 18 and just starting out, but my passion for pentesting is already burning bright. Currently, I'm studying tools and technical skills. It all began when I stumbled across a YouTube video about ethical hacking‚Äîwatching someone uncover vulnerabilities in systems was like solving a puzzle, and I was hooked. The idea of protecting systems by thinking like an attacker fascinated me.

I spend hours each day diving into the world of cybersecurity. I watch tutorials on platforms like TryHackMe and Hack The Box, following along with capture-the-flag challenges to learn how networks and systems work. I‚Äôve been experimenting with Kali Linux, trying tools like Nmap and Metasploit, even though I‚Äôm still figuring out the basics. Online courses and YouTube playlists about web security, SQL injection, and password cracking are my go-to resources.

I don‚Äôt know much yet, but I‚Äôm driven by curiosity. I practice in virtual labs, read blogs on Medium, and take notes. My goal is to master the fundamentals, earn certifications like eJPT, and one day become a skilled ethical hacker. Every small success‚Äîlike cracking my first practice VM‚Äîfuels my motivation to keep learning.
